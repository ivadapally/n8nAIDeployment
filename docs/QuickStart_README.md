## ðŸ“‚ Package Contents

| File | Purpose |
|:-----|:--------|
| `synthetic_clinical_data.csv` | 1,000 synthetic patient records |
| `train_and_generate_reports.py` | Python script to train model, predict risk, and generate reports |
| `tumor_marker_ai_workflow.json` | n8n workflow for automation |
| `Multi_Agent_Content_Generation_Summary.pdf` | Concept proposal overview for presentation |

## ðŸš€ QuickStart Steps

### 1. Python Environment Setup

Install the following libraries if you don't have them:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn fpdf markdown2
```

### 2. Run the Python Script

```bash
python train_and_generate_reports.py
```

This will:
- Train a Logistic Regression model on synthetic data.
- Predict cancer risk for patients.
- Generate reports in **HTML**, **Markdown**, and **PDF** formats.

Output Files:
- `report.html`
- `report.md`
- `report.pdf`

### 3. Load n8n Workflow

- Open your n8n dashboard.
- Import `tumor_marker_ai_workflow.json`.
- Edit the Gmail node to enter your email credentials (Gmail address + App password).
- Execute the workflow manually or schedule it.

### 4. Review Reports

After execution, review the generated reports and share them with your research or clinical teams!

## ðŸ§  Expansion Ideas

- Replace synthetic data with real-world clinical datasets.
- Add cloud storage (Google Drive, AWS S3) nodes for report saving.
- Connect EHR systems (FHIR APIs) for automatic data ingestion.
- Fine-tune Deep Learning models on imaging datasets.
